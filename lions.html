        <p class="body-text" id="body-text-1">My first day transitioning into Large Predators with the Africa Team, I got to meeting Beth, the head lion keeper at the zoo, and officially see the lions for the first time up close. It was truly amazing to realize firsthand how massive they were face to face and both my heart and mind were moving so fast! I especially recall feeling the vibrations of the lion's bellows and soft roars, as they watched me in their space deciding where I fit in their world.</p>

        <h2 class="secondary-header-title" id="second-title-1">THE LIONS</h2>
        <h3 class="third-header-text" id="source-white">A POEM OF REFLECTION</h3>
        <p class="body-text" id="body-text-1">Royalty & sophistication, though never lacking in occasional difficulty. Behemoth up close, radiating control even with roles reversed, on the other side. Dedicated to family and loving through action. Just as timeless as your origin itself, the world is enamored by your being and warm gaze, unreadable yet telling.</p>
