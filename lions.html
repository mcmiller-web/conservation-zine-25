            <p class="body-text" id="source-red">Meeting Beth, the head lion keeper and meeting the lions for the first time face to face, and truly realizing firsthand just how massive they were. I recall feeling the vibrations of their bellows and watching them observe me in their space, deciding where I fit in their world.</p>

            <h3 class="third-header-text" id="source-white">A POEM OF REFLECTION</h3>
            <p class="body-text" id="source-red">Royalty & sophistication, though never lacking in occasional difficulty. Behemoth up close, radiating control even with roles reversed, on the other side. Dedicated to family and loving through action. Just as timeless as your origin itself, the world is enamored by your being and warm gaze, unreadable yet telling.</p>
