        <p class="body-text" id="body-text-1">A few weeks into my time with small mammals, I was able to go into the giraffe paddock with Keeper Noah and feed the two Giraffes before starting my shift with bats. Noah and I had to move them to the other side of the outdoor holding areas, and I was alone with Desi, one of the giraffes, just feeding him and observing him. His slimy purple tongue, the crunch of the biscuits, and the gusts of air from his nose--needless to say, it felt unreal, but it was one of the best shifts ever.</p>

        <h3 class="third-header-text" id="source-white">A POEM OF REFLECTION</h3>
        <p class="body-text" id="body-text-1">Grace and an abundance of spontaneity are present in every graceful glide of each stride. Gental beings full of personality in slow motion, but capable of more than meets the eye. A quiet presence in such massive height and a joy that's only communicated through understanding. They grow on you.</p>
