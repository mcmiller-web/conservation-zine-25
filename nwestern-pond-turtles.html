        <p class="body-text" id="source-white">One of the most prominent conservation initiatives my internship was connected to was the Northwestern Pond Turtle species recovery. Through this initiative we were able to learn, observe, and educate majority of the youth that would visit the zoo and work with the keepers to then log and release  them into their natural habitat.</p>

        <h3 class="third-header-text" id="source-white">HOW WE CARED FOR THEM</h3>
        <p class="body-text" id="source-light">We release these turtles into the Columbia River Gorge, after caring for them in a simulated summer climate during the winter seasons. When they grew to be about 2 ounces, the conservation team would relocate them and occasionally re-visit them to monitor and track their progress, using a marking system on the outside ring of their shells.</p>
